# Full Implementation of Lee94 skeletonization in C++ 
This repository contains the source code for a full Implementation of Lee-94 sequential skeletonization in C++ using the Lee et. al 1994 medial axis thinning algorithm.
This skeletonization algorithm is the one used in FIJI, skimage. I rewrote the algorithm using C++
